     <h1>Black Girl Magic</h1>
     
     <h2>
        I am going to create a fashion website that is geared towards women of color. Black women in the fashion world is so hard to come by. Most websites and magazines are filled with white people and it is hard for other races to see how those clothes would look on them and their body type. We need websites that show the beauty of black women. I chose the name Black Girl Magic based on the campaign by the same name. It is about having black women uplift each other and talks about the everyday struggles that black women go through. Black women are just now starting to get their own hair care companies and I think having a fashion company that cares about them, supports them, and represent them is a wonderful thing. I am a huge fan of looking at clothing and hair designs. I want my website to work as both a look book, a place to get inspiration, and to also be able to buy the clothes the user sees. For the actual design aspects of the website, some popular websites I like to look at and I like the layout of are H&M, Zara, and Free People. I personally only shop at H&M but I liked some of the aspects I saw on Zara and Free Peopleâ€™s sites. I plan to take little bits and pieces from each site that I like but not to the point where there is too much going on for the user.
